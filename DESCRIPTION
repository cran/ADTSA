Description: Analyzes autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation using surrogate methods and 
  bootstrapping, and computes the acceleration constants for the vectorized moving block 
  bootstrap provided by this package. It generates percentile, bias-corrected, and accelerated 
  intervals and estimates partial autocorrelations using Durbin-Levinson. This package 
  calculates the autocorrelation power spectrum, computes cross-correlations between two 
  time series, computes bandwidth for any time series, and performs autocorrelation frequency 
  analysis. It also calculates the periodicity of a time series.
